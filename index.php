<p>As usual, we will provide you with an SLCC camp team at no cost. In return, we ask to collect each registered camper's contact information and ask that you give our team one hour in front of the camper's to promote SLCC. This hour can be dispersed throughout the week of camp. Our team can collect information of each camper or you can provide us with a registration list.</p>

<p>If you're from a college, you can <a href="register.php">register a college</a> that provides camp teams.</p>

<p>If you're preparing for a camp, you can <a href="request.php">request camp teams</a> from any of the colleges that have registered</p>
